- Hey! I'm Ian. <--- that's my name.
- I'm interested in doing some random code, out of the blue, and I'm currently in high school.
- I'm inexperienced, but I know the basics of programming in GML and batch. Yes, I know how to make some viruses.
- Brazilian artist, I know more about making art than anything else (commissions are not open, I can't make a bank account. YET!!)
- Desse jeito que escrevo em português brasileiro. Por quê faço isso? simplesmente porque eu quero. Lide com isso.
